# d3-tag-viz

This app uses the [ArcGIS REST API](http://www.arcgis.com/apidocs/rest/) and [D3](http://d3js.org/) to visualize the relationships between tagged items in ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS. 

The idea for this app is based on [this example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7607999) from Mike Bostock.
